1. install python :
    $ brew install python

2. install  conda in mac:
    brew install --cask anaconda
    export PATH="/opt/homebrew/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
    source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc / source ~/.bash_profile

    -- Type conda in the terminal. If the installation was successful, you should see the Conda help message. 

3. create venv for running python :
    steps:
    1. conda create -p venv python==3.13.4 
    2. conda activate venv/ 
    3. source activate base # ( this would activate your conda base env ) --> run this if you got CondaError: Run 'conda init' before 'conda activate'
        once above step complted run again step:2
    
    Now you can run python in this dir
    Eg. Create file with .py ext and type python <file-name>.py in terminal.

4. You can use jupitor file in vscode
    create file with ext .ipynb -> this will create same file as jupitore notebook. And gives you same interface as anaconda jupitor.
    For use this same venv for jupitor notebook file --> click on detect kerel in top right corner and select your created venv.
    now you can you can use 

    click shift + enter to run jupitor notebook cell 

5. to ignore venv dir pushing in git
    add **/.venv*/ in .gitignore
    - After updating .gitignore, if venv/ is already being tracked by Git, you must remove it from Git tracking:
        git rm -r --cached venv/
        git commit -m "Stop tracking virtual environment"
