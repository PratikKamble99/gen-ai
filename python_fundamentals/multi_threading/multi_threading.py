# Concurrency - treading.Thread, asyncio
# handling multiple tasks at the same time, but not necessarily to execute them simultaneously  
# Multiple tasks are in progress, but only one runs at any instant.

# Parallelism - multiprocessing.process, concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor
# Parallelism means executing multiple tasks at the exact same time using multiple CPU cores.
# Tasks are running literally at the same time
