# Everything in python is Object
#     eg. Number, Boolean
#     Code:
#         age = 2 // reference to address of 2 in memory
#         age = 12 // when you update value it does not not update value of va, it change reference of age var to address of 12 in memory
#         name = 2 // same referencing  to address of 2 in memory ie age referencing

# age = 2
# print(age)
# age = 12
# print(age)

print(id(2),"2")
print(id(1),"1")
# print(id(age), "age")
# print(id(12), "12")

# name=2
# print(id(name), "name")
# print(id(2), "2")
# print(id(age), "age")
